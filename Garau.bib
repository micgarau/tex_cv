  abstract = {Due to large scale introduction of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in the next generation distribution grid, real time monitoring and control is increasingly needed to maintain a stable operation. In such scenario, monitoring systems and state estimation are key tools for getting reliable and accurate knowledge of the grid. These real time applications have strong requirements on communication latency, reliability and security. This paper presents a method, based on Stochastic Activity Network modeling, for analyzing the performance and dependability of advanced communication technologies, such as LTE and 5G, for supporting monitoring system applications. A novel software tool, based on Möbius linked to external libraries, is developed and employed to analyze the impact of communication failures on the state estimation of a distribution grid. The application of the tool and its capabilities are demonstrated through a case study. The approach is promising both with respect to strength as a modelling tool and the kind of results obtained.},

The optimization strategy aims to find the best compromise between the conflicting objectives of minimal Signal Power, maximal Bit Rate, and minimal Bit Error Rate. The optimization is performed off line by means of a Multi-Objective approach. A set of Pareto solutions is determined, among which the designer has to take the final choice on the basis of the custom requirements. The approach is used to optimize the communication within a distributed energy storage system, which exploits an available electrical car fleet. The power lines supplying the charging points are used for the communication, while the information concerns, for each car, the identification code, the charge state, the schedule of charging/discharging. A unique OFDM modulation is used to dialogue with the whole cars fleet, so that it has to be optimized taking into account the frequency response of any involved power lines.},

Providing highways with proper charging infrastructure for future electric mobility demand is a problem that is not fully investigated in literature: in fact, previous work has not addressed grid planning and infrastructure design for both passenger vehicles and trucks on highways. In this work, the authors develop a methodology to design the electrical infrastructure that supplies static and dynamic charging for both modes of transport. An algorithm is developed that selects substations for the partial electrification of a highway and, finally, the design of the electrical infrastructure to be implemented is produced and described, assessing conductors and substations sizing, in order to respect voltage regulations. The system topology of a real highway (E18 in Norway) and its traffic demand is analyzed, together with medium-voltage substations present in the area.},

Developing an infrastructure that supports the substitution of the internal combustion engine and societal needs is no easy feat; different modes of transport and networks require specific analyses to match the requirements of the users and the capabilities of the power grid. In order to outline best practices and guidelines for a cost-effective and holistic charging infrastructure planning process, the authors have evaluated all the aspects and factors along the charging infrastructure planning cycle, analysing different methodological approaches from scientific literature over the last few years. The review starts with target identification (including transport networks, modes of transport, charging technologies implemented, and candidate sites), second, the data acquisition process (detailing data types sources and data processing), and finally, modelling, allocation, and sizing methodologies. The investigation results in a decision support tool to plan high-power charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, taking into account the interests of all the stakeholders involved in the infrastructure investment and the mobility value chain (distributed system operators, final users, and service providers).},

The developed application serves as a Proof of Concept for the potentials of using SDN as a security component in 5G. The performance of the controller application is evaluated by a sensitivity and specificity analysis, and it is validated through numerous experiments where parameters such as attack rate, detection threshold, flow entry timeout, and the number of malicious and benign nodes are varied.

Currently, co-simulation and Discrete Event Simulation (DES) are the most popular approaches to analyse the complexity of power grids seen as cyber-physical systems, and to help decision makers in identifying potential sources of failures and implement mitigation actions. This paper compares these two methods. Co-simulation and DES approaches are applied to a power system voltage regulation case study, and the capability of the methods to assess unsolved overvoltages due to simultaneous failures of power system and ICT system is comparatively discussed. Simulation time and assessment of voltage regulation operational costs for both methods are also compared.

  abstract = {Transition towards a smart grid requires network modernization based on the deployment of information and communication technologies for managing network operation and coordinating distributed energy resources in distribution systems. The success of the most advanced smart grid functionalities depends on the availability and quality of communication systems. Amongst the most demanding functionalities, those related to fault isolation, location and system restoration (FLISR) to obtain a self-healing smart grid are critical and require low latency communication systems, particularly in case of application to weakly-meshed operated networks. Simulation tools capable of capturing the interaction between communication and electrical systems are of outmost utility to check proper functioning of FLISR under different utilization conditions, to assess the expected improvements of Quality of Service, and to define minimum requirements of the communication system. In this context, this paper investigates the use of public mobile telecommunication system 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) for FLISR applications in both radially and weakly-meshed medium voltage (MV) distribution networks. This study makes use of a co-simulation software platform capable to consider power system dynamics. The results demonstrate that LTE can be used as communication medium for advanced fault location, extinction, and network reconfiguration in distribution networks. Furthermore, this paper shows that the reduction of performances with mobile background usage does not affect the system and does not cause delays higher than 100 ms, which is the maximum allowable for power system protections.},

The high number of buses, the radial topology, the small number of sensors and automated devices, require new approaches in managing fault conditions. These approaches must be able to deal with a high level of uncertainty of the state of the system and the measurement data. In this paper a novel method for fault location and isolation is proposed, which is based on the principle of entropy minimization. The algorithm builds a switch operation strategy which is able to locate the fault in a minimum number of manoeuvres, and therefore to reduce the impact of blackouts in terms of power unavailability. The application of the method on different distribution network topologies, with different levels of automation in terms of fault indicators and remotely controlled switches, demonstrates the potential of the method for distribution system analysis and supporting system automation planning.},

  abstract = {Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is fundamental to guarantee efficient monitoring, control and protection of smart distribution grids by interconnected Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs). The impact of failures in the IEDs communication service, and the dependency between the communication network and the power grid, need to be understood and taken into account when determining the optimal placement of IEDs. In this paper, the main objective is to investigate how loss of the communication service that connects the IEDs to Distribution Management System (DMS), will affect the placement of IEDs for smart grid monitoring and control. It is assessed the impact of 5G communication service failure on the IEDs placement with the objective to minimize the interruption costs (Cost of Energy Not Supplied), and the yearly expenses of the IEDs installed. The method is tested on the IEEE 33-bus radial distribution system, with a 5G communication network, covering both rural and urban areas. The results suggest a need for more IEDs per bus in the rural area because the power lines are longer, and the failure rates are higher than in the urban area. Furthermore, when introducing sub-regions that have higher power line failure rates and less reliable communication service, we observe that more IEDs are suggested to be placed in these regions. This demonstrates that methods for IEDs placement should take into consideration the ICT communication service failures, especially in sub-regions with higher power line failure rates and/or unstable ICT communication service that comes as result of failures in the power grid.},

  abstract = {The digital transition of the distribution grid management and operation requires efficient and reliable intelligent electronic devices (IEDs). Appropriate placement of IEDs in the distribution grid is crucial to guarantee high resilience, e.g. through remote monitoring, control and automation, and provide a high security of supply. In this paper, a novel approach for a cost-efficient placement of IEDs for fault location in radial distribution grids is proposed, which takes into account that IEDs might fail or are disconnected from the control system (e.g., Distribution Management System (DMS)). Genetic Algorithm is applied to solve the optimisation problem, with the objective to minimize the total annual cost, which is a compromise between the interruption costs (Cost of Energy Not Supplied), and the yearly expenses of the IEDs installed and their availability. To demonstrate the applicability, the method is tested on the IEEE 33-bus radial distribution system. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the method in supporting decision-making over different investment scenarios, and performing sensitivity analysis over IEDs' cost, taking into considerations the availability of the IEDs in a DMS.},

  abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS) and state estimation represent the key-tools for achieving a reliable and accurate knowledge of the power grid, and represent the foundation of an information-based operation of Smart Grids. Nevertheless, ICT brings new potential vulnerabilities within the power grid operation, that need to be evaluated. The strong interdependence between power system and ICT systems requires new methodologies for modeling the smart grid as a Cyber Physical System (CPS), and finally analyzing the impact of ICT failures on the power grid operation. This paper proposes a novel methodological approach that combines Stochastic Activity Networks (SAN) modeling and numerical computation for dependability analysis of a 5G-based WAMS. Internal influences such as component failures and external influences such as rain effect are considered, and the impact of these failures are assessed over the WAMS capability to provide reliable data for performing an accurate power network state estimation. Different state estimation approaches (traditional SCADA and PMU-based algorithms) and weather conditions are compared in terms of mean states estimation error and safety. The results highlight that 5G based WAMS result in a close-to-ideal behavior which enforces the prospect of a future adoption for smart grid monitoring applications.},
